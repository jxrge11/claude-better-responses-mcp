## Overview
The **claude-better-responses-mcp** repository provides a server that enhances Claude's coding responses. This project aims to improve the interaction between developers and AI by refining the output quality and relevance of Claude's coding assistance. The server leverages multi-agent systems to optimize responses, making it a valuable tool for developers looking to streamline their workflow.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Get high-quality coding assistance from Claude.
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Utilize multiple agents to improve response accuracy.
- **OpenAI Compatibility**: Seamlessly integrate with existing OpenAI tools.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Customize prompts for tailored responses.
- **Developer Tools**: Access a suite of tools designed for software engineers.

## Installation
To set up the MCP server, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jxrge11/claude-better-responses-mcp.git
   cd claude-better-responses-mcp
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can do this by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Download and Execute the Latest Release**:
   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/jxrge11/claude-better-responses-mcp/releases) to download the latest version. Follow the instructions in the release notes to execute the server.

## Usage
Once you have the server running, you can start interacting with Claude. Use the following commands to get started:

1. **Start the Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Send a Request**:
   You can send a request to Claude using a simple API call. Hereâ€™s an example using `curl`:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ask -d '{"question": "How do I implement a binary search?"}'
   ```

3. **Receive a Response**:
   The server will return a JSON object with Claude's response.

## Configuration
You can customize the server's behavior by modifying the configuration file. This file allows you to set parameters such as response length, prompt templates, and more.

### Example Configuration
```json
{
  "responseLength": 150,
  "promptTemplate": "Explain how to {task} in detail."
}
```
