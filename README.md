# 🚀 Claude SWE Advisor MCP Server(An agent which makes the responses better for SWEs)

   **Supercharge Claude for Real Software Engineering.**
> Improve Claude's coding responses with this MCP server
> Turn raw prompts into strategic engineering blueprints — with your own intelligent advisor agent.

## 🧠 What Is This?

This is the **first open-source Claude MCP (Multi-Context Prompting) server** equipped with a **custom Software Engineering (SWE) Advisor Agent** that transforms vague prompts into **production-ready, scalable, and maintainable solutions**.

Most LLMs respond immediately. This system slows Claude down — strategically. It inserts thinking steps like:

- ✅ Requirements elicitation  
- ✅ Stakeholder simulation  
- ✅ Risk & performance analysis  
- ✅ Software architecture planning  
- ✅ Maintainability & scalability readiness

> You’re not just getting code — you’re getting **engineering thought**.

## The Problem

Claude and other AI assistants jump straight to implementation without strategic thinking:
- ❌ Gives quick fixes instead of strategic solutions
- ❌ Misses performance, security, and scalability concerns  
- ❌ Creates technical debt with hasty implementations
- ❌ No architectural consideration or planning
- ❌ No functional/non-functional requirements  
- ❌ No architecture or testing plan  
- Just "code output" with assumptions

## The Solution

An MCP server that makes Claude consult with a senior software engineering advisor **before** answering your coding questions. This results in more thoughtful, strategic, and comprehensive responses.

## ⚡ See The Difference

I tested Claude with a simple web development request to demonstrate the dramatic improvement:

### Test Question
> "Hey, code me a landing page for a dual interface (garage managers and service seekers). These two kinds of people are my clients. I am building a web app to connect garages with users (service seekers)."

### ❌ Claude's Default Response (Direct Implementation)

**Requirements Gathering & Analysis:**
- **Informal Requirements:** Based directly on user request without structured analysis
- **Assumption-Based:** Made design decisions based on common landing page patterns
- **Single Developer Perspective:** Only my interpretation of requirements
- **No Stakeholder Input:** Didn't simulate consultation with different perspectives

**Technical Approach:**
- **Architecture:** Monolithic single-file approach
- **Documentation:** Minimal inline comments
- **Testing Strategy:** None specified
- **Maintenance Plan:** Not addressed

### ✅ Claude + Engineering Advisor Agent (Strategic Approach)

- Functional Requirements (FRs) + NFRs  
- Modular Architecture (PWA-ready)  
- Performance goals (60 FPS, <3s load)  
- WCAG 2.1 accessibility compliance  
- Error handling, analytics, test strategy  
- 15–20 pages of doc-style structured thinking

**Requirements Gathering & Analysis:**
- **Structured Requirements Elicitation:** Used software engineer agent to analyze and expand requirements
- **Stakeholder Simulation:** Agent acted as technical consultant providing expert perspective
- **Requirement Decomposition:** Broke down into functional, non-functional, and technical requirements
- **Risk Analysis:** Considered performance, accessibility, and scalability factors

**Detailed Functional Requirements:**
- **FR1: Dual Interface System**
  - FR1.1: Garage Manager portal section
  - FR1.2: Service Seeker portal section
  - FR1.3: Clear navigation between sections
  - FR1.4: Role-specific CTAs

- **FR2: Interactive Features**
  - FR2.1: Smooth scrolling navigation
  - FR2.2: Intersection observer animations
  - FR2.3: Ripple effects on interactions
  - FR2.4: Magnetic hover effects

- **FR3: Analytics & Tracking**
  - FR3.1: Event tracking system
  - FR3.2: Conversion monitoring
  - FR3.3: User journey analytics

**Comprehensive Non-Functional Requirements:**
- **NFR1: Performance** - Page load time < 3 seconds, 60 FPS animations
- **NFR2: Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, screen reader compatibility
- **NFR3: Scalability** - Modular architecture, component reusability
- **NFR4: Browser Compatibility** - Modern browser support with graceful degradation

## 📊 Key Improvements Achieved

| Aspect | First Approach | Second Approach |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Scope Definition** | Basic/Implicit | Comprehensive/Explicit |
| **User Stories** | Assumed | Detailed scenarios |
| **Edge Cases** | Not considered | Identified and handled |
| **Performance Criteria** | Undefined | Measurable targets |
| **Architecture** | Single-file monolith | Modular class-based |
| **Error Handling** | Basic | Comprehensive |
| **Testing Strategy** | None | Built-in tracking |
| **Documentation** | Minimal | Extensive inline docs |

## 🎯 Quality & Standards Comparison

### Requirements Completeness
- **Before:** 2-3 pages of basic requirements, minimal technical specifications
- **After:** 15-20 pages comprehensive documentation following IEEE 830 standards

### Risk Management
- **Before:** Performance not addressed, basic accessibility, modern browsers only
- **After:** Proactive optimization, full WCAG compliance, graceful degradation

### Maintenance & Scalability
- **Before:** Tightly coupled code, hard to modify, high technical debt
- **After:** Loosely coupled modules, easy to extend, service worker ready for PWA

  ## 🏗️ How It Works

1. 🧠 You write a prompt (e.g. "Build me a SaaS for XYZ")
2. 📡 Your SWE Advisor agent intercepts and enriches the prompt
3. 🔁 Claude receives the **refined**, **strategically layered** version
4. 💡 You get output that reads like it came from a senior software architect
   

## 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/skyline-GTRr32/claude-better-responses-mcp
cd claude-better-responses-mcp
```

2. **Run the MCP server:**
```bash
fastmcp run mcpserver.py:mcp
```

3. **Add to your Claude configuration:**
```json
"hello": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "mcp[cli]",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "C:\\Users\\path\\mcpserver.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

- Web development projects with multiple user types
- Performance optimization problems
- Architecture and design decisions  
- Technology selection and trade-offs
- Scaling and infrastructure challenges
- Code quality and technical debt issues
- Accessibility and compliance requirements

## 🚀 Quick Start

Once installed, simply ask Claude any software engineering question as usual. The MCP server will automatically enhance Claude's response with strategic consultation.

**Example:**
```
You: "Build me a REST API for my e-commerce app"

Claude (enhanced): "Let me consult with our engineering advisor first... 
[Comprehensive requirements analysis, architecture planning, security considerations, 
scalability design, and implementation roadmap]"
```

## 🏗️ How It Works

1. **Intercepts** your software engineering questions to Claude
2. **Consults** with a strategic engineering advisor framework
3. **Analyzes** requirements using industry-standard methodologies
4. **Enhances** Claude's response with comprehensive planning
5. **Delivers** production-ready, well-architected solutions

## 💡 The Bottom Line

**First Approach:** Rapid prototype mentality - quick delivery but limited long-term viability
**Second Approach:** Enterprise-grade development - comprehensive planning, robust architecture, and production-ready implementation

Transform Claude from giving you a quick prototype to delivering enterprise-grade software engineering solutions.
